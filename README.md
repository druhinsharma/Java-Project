🎓 Student Record Management System — Java Mini Project
🚀 About the Project
Managing student records manually can be tedious and error-prone. That’s why we built the Student Record Management System, a simple yet powerful Java-based desktop application using Java Swing!
This project helps automate the process of adding, searching, deleting, and viewing student records — all through an intuitive and attractive GUI.

Whether you're a beginner learning Java GUI programming or someone brushing up on OOP principles, this project is a perfect hands-on exercise.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Java

User Interface: Java Swing (Nimbus Theme)

Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Modular Design)

IDE: Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA

Java Version: JDK 8 or above

✨ Features
➕ Add new student with unique ID and age validation

🔍 Search students by ID

❌ Delete students by ID

📋 View all students at once

🔢 Display the total number of students

⚡ Real-time updates and success/failure messages

🎨 Beautiful and clean GUI layout

🖥️ How It Works
Add Student:
Fill in the student's ID, name, and age (must be ≥ 16). Validation prevents duplicate IDs!
